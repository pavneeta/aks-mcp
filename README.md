# AKS-MCP

The AKS-MCP is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI assistants to interact with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters. It serves as a bridge between AI tools (like GitHub Copilot, Claude, and other MCP-compatible AI assistants) and AKS, translating natural language requests into AKS operations and returning the results in a format the AI tools can understand.

It allows AI tools to:

- Operate (CRUD) AKS resources
- Retrieve details related to AKS clusters (VNets, Subnets, NSGs, Route Tables, etc.)
- Manage Azure Fleet operations for multi-cluster scenarios

## How it works

AKS-MCP connects to Azure using the Azure SDK and provides a set of tools that AI assistants can use to interact with AKS resources. It leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to facilitate this communication, enabling AI tools to make API calls to Azure and interpret the responses.

## How to install

### Local

<details>
<summary>Install prerequisites</summary>

1. Set up [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) and authenticate
```bash
az login
```
</details>

<br/>

Configure your MCP servers in supported AI clients like [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), [Claude](https://claude.ai/), or other MCP-compatible clients:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aks": {
      "command": "<path of binary aks-mcp>",
      "args": [
        "--transport", "stdio"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### GitHub Copilot Configuration in VS Code

For GitHub Copilot in VS Code, configure the MCP server in your `.vscode/mcp.json` file:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "aks-mcp-server": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "<path of binary aks-mcp>",
      "args": [
        "--transport", "stdio"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Options

Command line arguments:

```sh
Usage of ./aks-mcp:
      --access-level string   Access level (readonly, readwrite, admin) (default "readonly")
      --host string           Host to listen for the server (only used with transport sse or streamable-http) (default "127.0.0.1")
      --port int              Port to listen for the server (only used with transport sse or streamable-http) (default 8000)
      --timeout int           Timeout for command execution in seconds, default is 600s (default 600)
      --transport string      Transport mechanism to use (stdio, sse or streamable-http) (default "stdio")
```

**Environment variables:**
- Standard Azure authentication environment variables are supported (`AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`)

## Usage

Ask any questions about your AKS clusters in your AI client, for example:

```
List all my AKS clusters in my subscription xxx.

What is the network configuration of my AKS cluster?

Show me the network security groups associated with my cluster.

Create a new Azure Fleet named prod-fleet in eastus region.

List all members in my fleet.

Create a placement to deploy nginx workloads to clusters with app=frontend label.
