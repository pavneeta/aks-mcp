## AKS-MCP Server Capabilities

The prompts in this folder are designed to test and validate the following AKS-MCP server capabilities:

### Core Features (Currently Implemented)

#### Azure CLI Tools Integration
- Azure CLI (`az aks`) command execution through MCP tools
- Support for read-only, read-write, and admin access levels
- Individual command registration with security validation
- Account management commands (login, account set, list subscriptions)

#### Azure Resource Information Tools
- Virtual Network (VNet) information and configuration retrieval
- Network Security Group (NSG) rules and policies access
- Route table information and network routing details
- Subnet details and IP address management
- Load balancer configuration access (external and internal)

#### Security and Access Control System
- Three-tier access control (readonly, readwrite, admin)
- Command injection protection and security validation
- Access level enforcement at server and tool level
- Operation categorization and permission management

#### MCP Server Framework
- Model Context Protocol server implementation
- Multiple transport support (stdio, SSE, streamable-http)
- Dynamic tool registration based on access level
- AI assistant integration (VS Code Copilot, Claude, etc.)

#### Azure Resource Caching System
- In-memory caching for Azure resources and API responses
- Configurable cache timeouts and automatic expiration
- Thread-safe cache operations with performance optimization
- Multi-subscription cache management

### Future Planned Features

#### Monitoring and Observability (In Development)
- Azure Monitor integration and dashboard access
- Log Analytics workspace queries and log retrieval
- Application Insights performance monitoring and tracing
- Alert management and notification systems
- Performance metrics collection and analysis
- Real-time monitoring and data visualization

### Diagnostics and Advisory
- AppLens detector integration and execution
- Resource Health event monitoring and access
- Azure Advisor recommendations retrieval
- Automated diagnostic workflows and reporting
- Proactive issue detection and remediation guidance

### Security and Access Control
- Access level validation (readonly, readwrite, admin)
- Security policy enforcement and validation
- Authentication and authorization testing
- Role-based access control (RBAC) verification

## Adding New Prompt Files

When adding new prompt files to this folder:

1. **Follow naming conventions**: Use descriptive, lowercase names with hyphens (e.g., `cluster-operations.md`)
2. **Include clear objectives**: Each file should specify what functionality it tests
3. **Provide expected behaviors**: Document what responses are expected for each prompt
4. **Add prerequisites**: List any required setup, permissions, or resources
5. **Update this README**: Add the new file to the "Existing Files" section above
